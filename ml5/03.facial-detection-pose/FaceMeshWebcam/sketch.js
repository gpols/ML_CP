  Face mesh with a webcam

  Fun experiments with facemesh and particle systems:

  // We call our function to draw all keypoints
  // IDEA: like in previous sketches, there is no obligation to display the
  //       video, and you could for instance imagine a blank canvas where a few
  //       points from the face are used to draw vanishing circles, using the
  //       same logic as when you want a circle to leave a trail behind it when
  //       it moves?

  if (faces.length > 0) {

      // IDEA: in v0, you could get an 'unscaled' mesh (unnormalised version)
      //       that would then produce a smaller, fixed version of the face
      //       (e.g. in the upper left corner of the sketch), as the values
      //       were restricted to be always in the same range. You could still
      //       achieve that by using the width and the height of the sketch to
      //       normalise the values of the landmarks yourself! This in turn
      //       could be used if you wanted a face mesh that moves like the
      //       person being filmed, but that stays fixed (instead of being
      //       superimposed to the same location in the image). Proprely scaled
      //       again, this 'static' yet moving face could occupy the whole
      //       canvas, like a mirror!

      // Draw facial keypoints.
      for (let j = 0; j < keypoints.length; j++) {
        // the coordinates are given in 3D! Here we only use x & y
        const {x, y, z} = keypoints[j];

        fill(0, 255, 0);
        ellipse(x, y, 5, 5);
      }

    }

  }
}

// IDEA: the predictions object comes with a bounding box, accessible under the
//       `.boundingBox` property. This is also an object, with the x y coordinates of
//       the four corners as arrays: topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, bottomRight. A
//       nice exercise could be to write a function called drawBoundingBox, similar to
//       drawKeyPoints, that would:
//         - set the rectMode to CORNERS (using a push/pop logic for security)
//         - loop through all the predictions
//         - fetch the topLeft and bottomRight coordinates
//         - and draw the box! (You would call that function in draw after drawKeypoints.)
//       Note that you could imagine doing something different with that, just
//       as you could use the various face points in different ways. It is
//       probably particularly interesting if you focus on only some points
//       (maybe one in each cheek?), or perhaps three-four points that would allow
//       you to define an arc, a spline, or a BÃ©zier curve?
